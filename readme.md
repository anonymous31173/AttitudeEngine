- Text-based sentiment analysis.
- Language independent detection of sentiment within text statements.

Based on the work of SETI scientist [Laurance Doyle](http://www.seti.org/doyle)
this project aims to detect patterns in the frequency of language.

## Hypothesis

There a pattern to the words in an angry sentence vs a not angry one that is
independent of language.

## Data 

- Data files for this project have been generated by calculating the frequency
at which each word occurs across a collection of texts.
- The goal is to find trends based on where groups of words occur in their use.
